# Rename Script

Since this is a template repo, I wanted to make
renaming the project straightforward. Under the
menu option `Tools/Rename Template Assets` is a script
that will rename all the asset files in the project based
on a set of user settings as well as re-generate all
the GUIDs for unity assets to avoid asset collisions in the
future.
